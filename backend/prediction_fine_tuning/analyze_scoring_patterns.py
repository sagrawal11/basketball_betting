Scoring Pattern Analyzer
=========================
Analyzes completed NBA games to learn:
- How scoring is distributed across players
- Typical team totals
- Bench contribution patterns
- Optimal scaling factors for team score predictions

This DOES NOT modify player models - only tunes the prediction engine's
team score calculation logic.
