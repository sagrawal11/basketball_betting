- âœ… Season

## ðŸš€ Additional Inputs (HIGH IMPACT - Easy to Add)

### 1. **Injury Report / Player Status**
```python
injury_status: str  # "Healthy", "Probable", "Questionable", "Out"

## ðŸ“Š What I Recommend Adding FIRST:

### **Tier 1 (Must Have - Easy Wins):**
1. âœ… **Expected minutes** - Huge impact, easy to estimate
2. âœ… **Injury status** - Critical for accuracy
3. âœ… **Teammates out** - Changes usage rate
4. âœ… **Vegas total line** - You already have access!

### **Tier 2 (Should Have - Worth the Effort):**
5. âœ… **Primary defender** - Affects scoring
6. âœ… **Game importance** - Playoff race games differ
7. âœ… **Recent opponent pace** - Better than season average
8. âœ… **Starting vs bench** - Role matters

### **Tier 3 (Nice to Have - Advanced):**
9. Referee crew
10. Lineup combinations
11. Betting market signals
12. Altitude adjustment

## ðŸ’¡ Example Enhanced Prediction Call:

```python
preds = predictor.predict_player_stats(
    # BASIC (current)
    player_name='LeBron James',
    opponent_team='CHI',
    is_home=False,
    game_date='2025-10-15',
    season='2025-26',
    
    # TIER 1 (high impact)
    expected_minutes=35.0,
    injury_status='Healthy',
    teammates_out=['Anthony Davis'],  # AD injured
    vegas_game_total=218.5,
    
    # TIER 2 (medium impact)
    primary_defender='Alex Caruso',
    is_starter=True,
    game_importance='Rivalry',
    opponent_pace_last_10=102.5,  # Bulls playing fast recently
    
    # TIER 3 (nice to have)
    referee_crew=['Scott Foster'],
    nationally_televised=True,
    altitude='Normal'
)
```

Would you like me to implement the **Tier 1 inputs** (expected minutes, injury status, teammates out, vegas total)? These would significantly improve prediction accuracy!
